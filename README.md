# tamu-analytics
This is a repo for the TAMU Analytics class of 2018 to collaborate on Python and/or R projects...or anything else you bring to the table: Scala, Java, F#, etc.

1. Install GitHub: https://desktop.github.com

If you have a GitHub account (or need to set one up), send me your user name and I’ll make you a collaborator on the repo. 

2. Clone: Once Git is installed, you can “clone” the repo to your computer in the Git shell: 
a. Default folder should be “Documents\GitHub”
b. `git clone https://github.com/jbonfardeci/tamu-analytics.git`
c. `cd tamu*`

3. Branching: When you make changes, be sure to make a branch of the master. After you have the branch debugged working, you may merge your changes back into the master branch. 
```
git branch name_of_branch

git checkout branch_name

# make your changes, then:

git checkout master

git merge name_of_branch

git commit -m “comments”

git push (pushes changes to server)
```
